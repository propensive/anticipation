- minimalistic typeclass interfaces
- integration typeclasses for HTTP, HTML and CSS
- used by [Honeycomb](https://github.com/propensive/honeycomb/), [Cataract](https://github.com/propensive/cataract/) and [Scintillate](https://github.com/propensive/scintillate/)
- avoids dependencies in either direction between typeclass users and providers
