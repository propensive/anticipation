Anticipation has not yet been published. The medium-term plan is to build it with
[Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) and to publish it as a source build
on [Vent](https://github.com/propensive/vent). This will enable ordinary users
to write and build software which depends on Anticipation.

Subsequently, Anticipation will also be made available as a binary in the Maven
Central repository. This will enable users of other build tools to use it.

For the overeager, curious and impatient, see [building](#building).
